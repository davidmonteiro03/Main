## Platform to support the teaching of programming

<p>
    Use CODEin-IP to develop your programming skills.<br>
    Programming is challenging and develops your logical thinking!<br>
    But... it requires commitment and the acquisition of specific skills that are developed through training!<br>
    Solve the exercises on this platform and, in the future, you'll be able to develop complex programs such as CODEin!<br>
    To use the platform, follow these steps:<br>
    - Register using the «Inscrições\Do Colégio» function;<br>
    - Log in to the platform with your (school) username and password;<br>
    - Find a problem and submit it «Concurso\Problemas»;<br>
    - When you solve a problem correctly you are awarded points;<br>
    - Try to increase your ranking by solving as many problems as you can;<br>
    - The teacher will pay attention to your work.<br>
    Attention:<br>
    - CODEin-IP is for CIC students only (or ex-students, like me);<br>
    - Your entry must be approved by your teacher;<br>
    - Only submit your solution after testing it, as incorrect submissions will be penalized.
